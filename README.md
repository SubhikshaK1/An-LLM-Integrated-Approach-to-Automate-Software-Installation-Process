# An-LLM-Integrated-Approach-to-Automate-Software-Installation-Process

Research Paper - (Presented), Technologies: Python, LLM, Gemimi API, Winget, CLI

Integrated Winget package manager with Googleâ€™s Gemini API to provide AI-driven software recommendations and automate installations through a user-friendly CLI that interprets natural language inputs and offers context-aware suggestions.

Modern software installation challenges: Finding, installing, and managing applications efficiently.
Solution: AI-powered installation assistant leveraging Winget and Google's Gemini API.
Benefits: Automated installation, intelligent recommendations, enhanced user experience.

Winget: Command-line package manager for Windows, simplifies software discovery and installation.

Gemini API: Google's large language model (LLM) API for advanced package analysis and recommendations.

Traditional package managers lack contextual understanding of user needs and intelligent recommendation capabilities.

Problem Formulation:

> Lack of intelligent package selection based on user-defined criteria.

> Dependency on GUI-based tools for automation.


Proposed System:

Four layers: User Interface, Core System Components, AI Analysis, External Services.

Winget Manager interacts with the Winget CLI.

Gemini API Client interacts with the Google Gemini API.

Package Parser extracts structured data from Winget output.

Recommendation Generator creates contextualized installation suggestions.

Initial Request Processing: User input via CLI.

Package Discovery & Analysis: Winget search and parsing.

AI-Powered Analysis: Gemini analyzes package metadata.

Recommendation Generation: Gemini suggests suitable packages.

User Decision Support: Display recommendations and alternatives.

Installation Process: Winget installation with real-time monitoring.

Results - User Interaction:

> User inputs software name via command line.

> System performs Winget search and sends results to Gemini

> AI-powered recommendations displayed with rationale

> User selects package by numerical input

> Confirmation prompt ensures user control

> Real-time installation progress feedback provided

> Package unavailability handling

>Duplicate installation detection

> API failure fallback recommendations

> Installation error reporting

> User-friendly error messages

Example: PHP installation scenario

Multiple package options analyzed 

Intelligent recommendations based on use case

Package verification before installation

Successful installation confirmation 



Successfully integrated Winget package manager with Google's Gemini API

Created intelligent software installation assistant with contextual recommendations

Addressed limitations of traditional package managers

Improved user experience through AI-powered guidance

Demonstrated viable approach for next-generation software management
